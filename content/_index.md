# Hi, I'm ...

Ashu Goyal, I'm a software engineer who enjoys building reliable backend systems that support real products and real people.

Currently working as a Product Engineer at Sprinto, where I focus on platform infrastructure, workflow orchestration, and system reliability. I've worked across early-stage teams and enterprise environments, building async job systems, real-time integrations, and developer tools that reduce manual effort.

I care about writing code that's easy to debug and build on — even if I'm not the one maintaining it.

While I enjoy learning new tools, I tend to stay focused on fundamentals: _clean interfaces, useful logs, and building for failure_.

_Lately, I've been working on workflow orchestration with Temporal, building reusable patterns for long-running processes, and creating developer tools that make complex systems easier to debug and maintain._

_I've published several developer resources including [stacked-pr-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stacked-pr-sync) for Git workflow automation and production-ready observability templates._

## 🔍 How I Think About Engineering

I try to build systems that are simple, reliable, and easy to reason about. I care more about clarity than cleverness — and I think good engineering often comes down to making the right trade-offs, not chasing the most complex solution.

If something breaks, I want it to fail in a way that's easy to understand and fix. If someone reads my code six months later, I want them to feel at home.

## 🧘‍♂️ Beyond Code

Outside of work, I enjoy walking, reflecting, and reading about system architecture. I've also started playing outdoor games recently — mostly to keep my back straight and stay active 😀

I like helping friends think through technical decisions too — whether it's for a side project or something more ambitious.
