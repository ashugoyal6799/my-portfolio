## ðŸš€ Stacked PR Sync

**My first npm package!** A simple tool to sync stacked pull requests with smart conflict detection.

- **Published on npm**: [stacked-pr-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stacked-pr-sync)
- **Features**: Smart conflict detection, auto-stash, branch status reporting
- **Tech**: Node.js, Git automation, CLI tools

Perfect for teams working with stacked pull requests - automatically syncs branches in sequence and stops on conflicts for manual resolution.
