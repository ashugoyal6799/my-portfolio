## 🛠️ Developer Templates & Utilities

### 🔍 Observability Stack

**Repository**: [github.com/ashugoyal6799/observability-stack](https://github.com/ashugoyal6799/observability-stack)

**Express template** with comprehensive monitoring and logging setup.

Debugging production issues without proper logging is like flying blind. I needed a solution that would give me structured logs, error tracking, and request tracing — all without the complexity of enterprise monitoring tools.

This Express.js application integrates AWS CloudWatch for centralized logging and Sentry for error tracking. Perfect for side projects that need production-grade observability without the overhead.
