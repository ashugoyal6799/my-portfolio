## DineMidway

**Website**: [dinemidway.com](https://dinemidway.com)

Planning dinner with friends often turned into endless back-and-forth â€” someone suggests a spot, someone else says it's too far, and the group chat drags on.

I built DineMidway to make this easier. It finds places that keep travel fair by balancing distance, ratings/reviews, and filters you set. The goal: nobody feels stuck with the longest drive, and plans actually move forward. ðŸš—âœ¨

## Kite Portfolio Tracker

**Repository**: [github.com/ashugoyal6799/kite-portfolio-tracker](https://github.com/ashugoyal6799/kite-portfolio-tracker)

Manual portfolio tracking was eating up my time â€” logging into Zerodha, copying data to spreadsheets, calculating P&L, and emailing reports to family.

I built this Node.js tool to automate the entire workflow. It fetches real-time holdings from Zerodha Kite Connect, generates detailed Excel reports, and emails them automatically. Now my portfolio tracking happens in the background while I focus on actual investing decisions. ðŸ“ˆ
