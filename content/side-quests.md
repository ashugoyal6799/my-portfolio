## DineMidway

**Website**: [dinemidway.com](https://dinemidway.com)

Planning dinner with friends often turned into endless back-and-forth someone suggests a spot, someone else says it's too far, and the group chat drags on.

I built DineMidway to make this easier. It finds places that keep travel fair by balancing distance, ratings/reviews, and filters you set. The goal: nobody feels stuck with the longest drive, and plans actually move forward. 🚗✨

## Threadly

**Website**: [phoenixperforma.com/threadly](https://phoenixperforma.com/threadly)

Finding past conversations in Slack channels with thousands of messages is frustrating endless scrolling, missed context, and incomplete search results. New team members struggle to catch up, and even existing members waste time hunting for discussions.

Threadly is an AI-powered Slack assistant that makes it easy to find and understand topic based conversations. Instead of scrolling through message history, you can simply ask "What did people say about the cricket match?" and get relevant messages, summaries, and AI-powered chat on the discussion.

Built as a Slack Bot that syncs historical messages to MongoDB, uses PostgreSQL for workspace management, and leverages the Slack Events API for real-time updates. The AI querying layer finds relevant messages, sends them to ChatGPT for summarization, and returns quick links — perfect for busy teams and new joiners who need to understand context fast.

## Kite Portfolio Tracker

**Repository**: [github.com/ashugoyal6799/kite-portfolio-tracker](https://github.com/ashugoyal6799/kite-portfolio-tracker)

Manual portfolio tracking was eating up my time logging into Zerodha, copying data to spreadsheets, calculating P&L, and emailing reports to family.

I built this Node.js tool to automate the entire workflow. It fetches real-time holdings from Zerodha Kite Connect, generates detailed Excel reports, and emails them automatically. Now my portfolio tracking happens in the background while I focus on actual investing decisions.
