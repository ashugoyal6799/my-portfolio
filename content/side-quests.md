## DineMidway

**Website**: [dinemidway.com](https://dinemidway.com)

Planning dinner with friends often turned into endless back-and-forth â€” someone suggests a spot, someone else says it's too far, and the group chat drags on.

I built DineMidway to make this easier. It finds places that keep travel fair by balancing distance, ratings/reviews, and filters you set. The goal: nobody feels stuck with the longest drive, and plans actually move forward. ðŸš—âœ¨
