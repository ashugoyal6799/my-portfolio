AI is changing software work in a very specific way: **writing code is getting easier, but shipping good software isn't.**
So the advantage is moving from "who can type fastest" to "who can deliver safely, consistently."

Here's what that means depending on where you are.

## If you're a junior engineer

- **Don't sell yourself as "I can code." Sell yourself as "I can finish things."**
  Lots of people can generate code now. What teams need is someone who can take a task, ask the right questions, break it down, and get it shipped.

- **Use AI a lot but don't hide behind it.**
  It's totally fine to use Cursor/Claude Code/Gemini CLI. Just be the person who can explain what the code is doing and why it won't blow up in production.

- **Get really good at "checking."**
  AI often produces code that _looks_ right. Your value is spotting what's missing: edge cases, bad assumptions, security issues, weird race conditions, slow queries, broken error handling.

- **Build one strong project instead of five small ones.**
  A "real" project usually has boring stuff: auth, validation, background jobs, retries, rate limiting, logs, tests, CI, deployment. That boring stuff is exactly what makes you job ready.

- **Learn fundamentals, but don't overdo the theory.**
  You don't need to be a LeetCode machine. But you should be able to debug, read stack traces, understand complexity, and know when AI output is nonsense.

- **Be open to sideways entry roles.**
  If junior SWE roles are tight, get into the system however you can: QA automation, support engineering, data work, internal tools. Once you're in, it's easier to move.

- **Try to be broad early, then pick something to go deep in.**
  Learn enough frontend, backend, and deployment to be useful. Then choose one area to get sharp: reliability, security, UX, data, performance anything you genuinely enjoy.

## If you're a senior engineer

- **Your job is less "write code" and more "make the team effective."**
  You're paid for decisions: architecture, tradeoffs, risk management, and keeping things simple enough that people can move fast.

- **If the team has fewer juniors, you need better systems.**
  You can't rely on "everyone remembers the checklist." Put it in the workflow: CI, linting, tests, review guidelines, staging, monitoring, runbooks. That's how you avoid constant firefighting.

- **Treat AI like a powerful intern.**
  It's fast and helpful, but it needs supervision. Set clear rules: where AI-generated code is fine, and where it needs serious review (auth, payments, privacy, anything safety related).

- **Don't become a PR janitor.**
  The best senior engineers won't just review more code they'll shape how work gets done: boundaries, interfaces, tooling, guardrails, and how the system fails.

- **Deep experience matters more now.**
  When easy stuff gets automated, the remaining work is the hard stuff: scaling, reliability, security, performance, messy integrations, real world edge cases.

- **Push to keep the pipeline alive.**
  Teams that stop training juniors look efficient for a while and then they hit a wall later. Mentorship, onboarding, and delegation still matter.

- **Stay flexible.**
  Keep your specialty, but learn enough around it (cloud, security, data, product thinking) to adapt when tools and stacks change.

## What applies to everyone

- **AI makes output easier. It also makes mistakes cheaper to create.**
  Speed is great, but only if quality keeps up.

- **Judgment is the real skill.**
  Knowing when to trust the tool, when to slow down, and what to double check.

- **Communication keeps winning.**
  If you can turn unclear requirements into a clear plan and keep people aligned you'll stay valuable no matter what changes.
