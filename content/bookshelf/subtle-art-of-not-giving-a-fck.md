## Why I Picked This Up

Honestly? The title. But beyond the clickbait, I was tired of the "positive vibes only" self-help culture. This book promised a different take, and it delivered.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. You're Always Choosing What to Care About

You have a limited amount of energy. The question isn't whether you'll give a f*ck -- you always will. The question is *what* you give a f*ck about. Choose wisely, because caring about the wrong things is exhausting.

### 2. Pain Is Part of the Deal

Every pursuit comes with its own flavour of suffering. The real question isn't "what do I want?" but "what pain am I willing to endure?" The person who loves the *process* of training -- not just the idea of being fit -- is the one who actually gets fit.

### 3. You Are Not Special (And That's Okay)

The entitlement epidemic -- thinking you deserve extraordinary outcomes without extraordinary effort -- is real. Accepting that you're average at most things is actually liberating. It lets you focus on the few things that genuinely matter to you.

### 4. Certainty Is the Enemy of Growth

The more certain you are about something, the less open you are to learning. Being wrong isn't failure -- refusing to update your beliefs is.

## Favourite Quotes

> "Who you are is defined by what you're willing to struggle for."

> "The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience."

## How It Changed My Thinking

I stopped trying to care about everything equally. I became more deliberate about where I invest my emotional energy -- at work, in relationships, online. It's not about being apathetic; it's about being selective.

## Who Should Read This

Anyone feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to be happy, successful, and perfect all the time. It's a reality check wrapped in dark humour.
