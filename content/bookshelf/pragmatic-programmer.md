## Why I Picked This Up

I kept seeing this recommended everywhere -- on Reddit, Twitter, in senior engineers' "must-read" lists. After a year of professional coding, I wanted to level up from "writing code that works" to "writing code that lasts."

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Don't Live with Broken Windows

One broken window -- a bad piece of code, a poor decision nobody fixed -- leads to more. Entropy creeps in. The moment you let quality slide, the whole codebase starts rotting. Fix the small things before they become big things.

### 2. DRY Is About Knowledge, Not Code

"Don't Repeat Yourself" isn't just about avoiding copy-paste. It's about not duplicating *knowledge*. If a business rule lives in two places, one of them will eventually be wrong. This shifted how I think about abstractions entirely.

### 3. Tracer Bullets > Big Bang

Instead of building the whole system and hoping it works, build a thin end-to-end slice first. Get something working across all layers -- even if it's basic. Then iterate. This is how you reduce risk and learn fast.

### 4. Be a Catalyst for Change

Don't ask for permission to improve things. Start small, show results, and people will follow. The "stone soup" story from the book is a perfect metaphor for driving change in a team.

> "Don't gather requirements -- dig for them. Requirements rarely lie on the surface."

## How It Changed My Thinking

I started treating my code like a craft, not just a task. I became more intentional about naming, structure, and documentation. Most importantly, I stopped waiting for someone to tell me to fix things -- I just started fixing them.

## Who Should Read This

Every developer in their first 3 years. And then again after 5 years -- you'll notice completely different things the second time around.
