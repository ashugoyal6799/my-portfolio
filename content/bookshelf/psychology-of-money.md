## Why I Picked This Up

Everyone talks about investing, markets, and strategies. But nobody talks about *why* we make dumb decisions with money even when we know better. That's exactly what this book tackles.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. No One's Crazy

Everyone makes financial decisions based on their own unique life experiences. What looks irrational from the outside makes perfect sense to the person doing it. A person who grew up during hyperinflation will never see money the same way as someone who grew up in a stable economy.

### 2. Wealth Is What You Don't See

The fancy car isn't wealth -- it's spending. Real wealth is the money you *don't* spend. This one hit hard. We're so conditioned to show off that we forget the whole point of having money is the freedom it gives you, not the things it buys.

### 3. Reasonable > Rational

You don't need to be perfectly rational with money. You need to be reasonable -- something you can stick with long-term without losing sleep. The "optimal" portfolio means nothing if you panic-sell at the first dip.

### 4. The Power of Compounding

Warren Buffett's net worth crossed $1 billion after he turned 56. Not because he's the best investor, but because he started at age 10 and never stopped. Time is the real cheat code.

## Favourite Quotes

> "No one is crazy. Everyone makes financial decisions based on their own unique experiences that seem to make sense to them in a given moment."

> "Getting money and keeping money are two different skills."

## How It Changed My Thinking

I stopped chasing "optimal" and started chasing "sustainable." I think less about maximising returns and more about building habits I can stick with for decades. Also, I stopped judging people for their financial decisions -- everyone's playing a different game.

## Who Should Read This

Anyone who earns money. Seriously. Whether you're a student or a CEO, this book reframes how you think about wealth, risk, and time.
